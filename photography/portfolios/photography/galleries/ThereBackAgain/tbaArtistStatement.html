            During the summer of 2015, I lived for six weeks in Aix-en-Provence, France.
            There & Back Again is an exploration of the discomfort I faced during this first journey into a foreign land, and the unexpected emotions upon my return home.
            Since I had never lived outside of the state of South Carolina, I expected homesickness. <br /><br />

            However, I did not realize just how displaced I would feel.
            Six weeks is not a long time, but it was long enough to develop daily routines and rituals.
            It was enough for the unfamiliar to become the familiar, and the uncomfortable to become comfortable.
            I found myself happy to be back when I returned home until a month passed, after which I began longing for certain familiarities back in France.<br /><br />

            I began photographing home with freshly traveled eyes, seeking comparisons and contrasts with the images I made in France with a miniature instant film camera.
            I found that there is a novelty about instant film that mimics the romance of Europe.
            The images themselves come out slightly distorted from the lack of control in the camera, so that they almost resemble an impressionist's painting, fabricating a dreamlike picture. <br /><br />

            I took a particular notice in the stark contrast between the geographical environments and how the different cultures interacted with the land.
            Each image is either taken in the dry, bright sun of Aix-en-Provence, or in the comfort of my hometown, Moncks Corner, South Carolinaâ€”within the context of my personal experience in both locations.
            They serve to document my memories as I transition in and out of my comfort zone during my travels and as I adjust to life back home.
