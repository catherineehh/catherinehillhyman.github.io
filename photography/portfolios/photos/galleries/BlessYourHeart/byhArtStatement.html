            Currently I am writing a book called <i>Bless Your Heart</i>, which features a photographer named Zoe as the main protagonist.
            Zoe grew up in the rural south of the US where her grandfather often took her hunting.<br /><br />

            She mostly shoots weddings and events with a digital camera for a living.
            However, she is obsessed with analogue photography, and she will bring her cameras when she goes hunting with her grandfather.<br /><br />

            Most of these images document my own experiences that have influenced this book, while the others attempt to capture the horrors Zoe experiences later on in the book.<br /><br />

            Zoe would enjoy shooting with the cameras I used in this series.
            I documented a few hunts with my uncle using a 35mm Canon, which was not staged.
            The images of the woman (a dear cousin of mine) are staged, and I captured her stunning portraits with a medium format Hassleblad.
