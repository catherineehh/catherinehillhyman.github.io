          Welcome to my portfolio! Designed and developed by me. <br /><br />

          I made websites for fun in middle school and high school, but I didn't consider doing it as a career until recently.
          I've been set on photography and art since I can remember anything ever.
          In 2016, I earned a bachelor degree in Studio Art with emphasis on photography, and a minor in Art History.<br /><br />

          However, the lifestyle I want requires a different profession.
          At least full time!
          So, I'm back in school for a certificate in Internet Programming, which I will finish by the end of this year.<br /><br />

          I still make photographs and write whenever I can.
          Check out an excert of my upcoming vampire book, <i>Bless Your Heart</i> in my writing portfolio!<br /><br />

          I'm kind of obsessed with vampires.
